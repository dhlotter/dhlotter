keep it simple
Desiring less is even more valuable than owning less

live with intent. live an intentional life. look at your goals and craft your weeks/months/quarters/years accordingly.
disable distractions

whenever you have some free time (at least once a day) send someone you haven't messaged in a while a message. just scroll to the bottom.

just like when you free up money you need to know what you will do with it. the same goes for time, once you free it up, what will you be doing with it?
